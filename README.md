# wordle-unity
A Wordle clone made in the Unity game engine.

The keyboard at the bottom doesn't work to type in letters, but the characters are marked appropriately. Also there are no stats. The other difference is that I only implemented one dictionary. The original uses two - one with about 2300 words that the answers are picked from, and one with around 12K words that is all the words you allowed to enter. My version has one dictionary with about 2300 words and if you enter one not in that list it will just give you the not in word list error. Feel free to implement a second dictionary like the original.
