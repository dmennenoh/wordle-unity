# wordle-unity
A Wordle clone made in the Unity game engine.

The keyboard at the bottom doesn't work to type in letters, but the characters are marked appropriately. Also there are no stats. The other difference is that I only implemented one dictionary. The original uses two - one with about 2300 words that the answers are picked from, and one with around 12K words that is all the words you allowed to enter. My version only has one dictionary with about 2300 words and if you enter one not in that list it will just give you the 'not in word list' error. It's a clean list though. Like the NY Times one there are no plurals I.e. if it's a four letter word like 'ride' then 'rides' will not be in the list. Also like the original, you can't play more than once per day. You will have to wait until midnight for it to select a new word. Unless you change it. Enjoy.
